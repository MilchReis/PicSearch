# PicSearch
A simple tool to find your images, by drawing them from your last remember. This project is just an experiment to trying out to implement a routine for that problem.
I implement a simple user interface to provide the basic operations. A dialog for changing settings is not available until now. Moreover the algorithm is not tested enough, so it produces no accurate results..

### Download and Build ###
The latetest version of the picsearch program is hosted on github. Feel free to [download](https://github.com/MilchReis/PicSearch/raw/master/build/PicSearch.jar "download-address") it. On windows the program starts normally with a double click on the file. On linux set the execute-flag, f. e. `chmod 755 picsort.jar` and start with `java -jar picsort.jar` in the terminal.

Until now I create the executable jar-file with the build-in eclipse export system. If you want to build your program for your self, download the source and import the project into eclipse. After that export the project as 'runnable jar'.
